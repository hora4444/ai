Wildcats are wildcats that live in the mountains and fields of Korea, similar in appearance to housecats, but slightly larger and more embellished. The body has vivid dark stripes, and the tail is thick and dark at the end. They rest on branches and rocks during the day because they are nocturnal animals, and go hunting for mice, birds, and frogs when darkness falls. Wildcats used to be common throughout the country, but now their habitat has shrunk and their populations have decreased due to road accidents and poaching. They are considered natural monuments and endangered wildlife.Although there is an unfamiliar and wild feeling to the human eye, wildcats are important beings that balance the ecosystem. One of the reasons we need to conserve and protect nature is to allow these lives to continue to live by our side.
